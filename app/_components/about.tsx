          Hello! My name is Thanos! I decided to dedicate my life to the pursuit of
          software development. As a product-oriented engineer, I want my software to be useful, 
          performant, and scalable. 
          My addiction to lifelong learning, coupled with the joy of constant growth, enables me to keep my skills updated.
